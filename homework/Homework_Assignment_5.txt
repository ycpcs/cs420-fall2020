1) Consider the deadlock situation that could occur in the dining-philosophers 
problem when the philosophers obtain the chopsticks one at a time. Discuss how the 
four necessary conditions for deadlock indeed hold in this setting. Discuss how 
deadlocks could be avoided by eliminating any one of the four conditions.




2) Consider a system consisting of four resources of the same type that are shared 
by three processes, each of which needs at most two resources. Show that the system is 
deadlock-free.




3) Consider the following snapshot of a system:

    Process     Allocation         Max         Available
    -------    ------------    -----------    -----------
                 A B C D         A B C D        A B C D
    -------    ------------    -----------    -----------
      P0         0 0 1 2         0 0 1 2        1 5 2 0
      P1         1 0 0 0         1 7 5 0
      P2         1 3 5 4         2 3 5 6
      P3         0 6 3 2         0 6 5 2
      P4         0 0 1 4         0 6 5 6

Answer the following questions using the bankerâ€™s algorithm:

a) What is the content of the matrix Need?

b) Is the system in a safe state?  If so, provide a sequence that would allow all 
processes to run to completion

c) If a request from process P1 arrives for (0,4,2,0), can the request be granted 
immediately (i.e. would the system still be in a safe state if the request were
granted)?  If so, provide a safe sequence that would allow all processes to run to
completion.
